          <h3> Keep yourself and others safe: Do it all!</h3>       
           <p>Get vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn and follow local guidance on vaccination.
            Keep physical distance of at least 1 metre from others, even if they don’t appear to be sick. Avoid crowds and close contact.
            Wear a properly fitted mask when physical distancing is not possible and in poorly ventilated settings.</p>

      <h3> Wear a mask properly</h3>      
       <p>Make sure your mask covers your nose, mouth and chin.
        Clean your hands before you put your mask on, before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any time.
        When you take off your mask, store it in a clean plastic bag, and every day either wash it if it’s a fabric mask or dispose of it in a trash bin if it’s a medical mask.
        Don’t use masks with valves</p>

      <h3>Make your environment safe</h3>        
       <p>Avoid the 3Cs: spaces that are closed, crowded or involve close contact.
        Meet people outside. Outdoor gatherings are safer than indoor ones, particularly if indoor spaces are small and without outdoor air coming in.
        If you can’t avoid crowded or indoor settings, take these precautions:
        Open a window to increase the amount of natural ventilation when indoors.</p>
